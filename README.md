Navigation Using Visual Odometry - Final project for Intro to Computer Vision at Colorado School of Mines

## Visual Odometry
Initial implementation using this blog post as a guide: https://avisingh599.github.io/vision/visual-odometry-full/

## Validation data
Using the TUM VI dataset for validation data. See 
https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/visual-inertial-dataset

The raw ```.bag``` files from the public dataset are too large to add to the repo. They can be put in ```data/raw/``` which is in ```.gitignore```.
```data/extracted``` contains video feeds extracted from the dataset and encoded as ```.avi``` files. ```data/intermediates``` contains processed video files.
